I'm **Sri Varsha Mekala** 👋  

Information Technology student (2nd Year) at **VNR VJIET, Hyderabad**.

I enjoy working on real-world problem statements and building user-focused applications, while also being deeply interested in Data Structures, algorithms, and problem solving.
I’m keen on communicating and engaging with people, and I see myself as a confident leader and orator who enjoys collaborating in teams and driving ideas forward for impactful startup and hackathon projects.

Feel free to connect with me!
